# Design Document and System Architecture Overview

## Design Choices

1. Frontend Framework: Next.js
   - Chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities, API routes, and seamless integration with React.
   - Provides excellent performance and SEO benefits.

2. Styling: Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
   - Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and consistent design.
   - shadcn/ui for pre-built, customizable React components.

3. State Management: React Hooks
   - Used React's built-in state management capabilities for simplicity.
   - For more complex state management needs, consider integrating Redux or Zustand.

4. Form Handling: Custom implementation
   - Implemented custom form handling for complete control over validation and submission.
   - Consider using react-hook-form for more complex forms in the future.

5. Authentication: Server-side with cookies
   - Implemented a basic cookie-based authentication system.
   - For production, consider using a more robust solution like NextAuth.js.

## System Architecture

1. Frontend (Next.js Application)
   - Pages:
     - Public Form (`/`)
     - Login Page (`/login`)
     - Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
     - Leads List (`/admin/leads`)
   - Components:
     - Form components (Input, Select, RadioGroup, etc.)
     - Admin components (Sidebar, LeadsDataTable, etc.)
   - API Routes:
     - `/api/leads` (GET, POST)
     - `/api/auth/login` (POST)
     - `/api/auth/logout` (POST)

2. Backend (Next.js API Routes)
   - Currently mocked, but designed to be easily replaced with a real backend:
     - Lead submission
     - Lead retrieval
     - Authentication

3. Database (Not implemented, but designed for)
   - Tables:
     - Users (for admin access)
     - Leads (for storing submitted lead information)

4. Authentication Flow
   - Login: POST to `/api/auth/login`
   - Session management: Cookie-based
   - Protected routes: Server-side redirect for unauthenticated users

5. Data Flow
   - Lead Submission:
     1. User fills out form on frontend
     2. Form data sent to `/api/leads` (POST)
     3. Backend validates and stores lead information
     4. User redirected to thank you page
   - Lead Retrieval (Admin):
     1. Admin logs in
     2. Frontend requests lead data from `/api/leads` (GET)
     3. Backend retrieves and returns lead data
     4. Frontend displays lead data in LeadsDataTable

6. Deployment (Proposed)
   - Vercel for hosting the Next.js application
   - Database hosting (e.g., PostgreSQL on Heroku or Amazon RDS)
   - Environment variables for configuration management

## Future Improvements

1. Implement robust error handling and logging
2. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
3. Implement a real backend with database integration
4. Enhance security measures (e.g., rate limiting, CSRF protection)
5. Improve accessibility features
6. Implement more advanced filtering and sorting in the admin dashboard
7. Add user management features for admin users
